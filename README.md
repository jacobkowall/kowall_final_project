# kowall_final_project

This repository contains all my files for my final project.

<p>For this project, I performed a distant reading of a corpus of novels by British adventure authors active during the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century.

<p>The "Cytoscape" folder contains my network visualilzation in the form of a cytoscape program file. It also contains two image files of overlaps visualized in the Cytoscape network.

<p>The "Stylo of all texts" folder contains an Excel file produced by Stylo.

<p>The "Stylo_Ballantyne" folder contains the text files produced by the Stylo "oppose" function. It also contains the graphs created on Voyant to visualize the change in the word usage in Ballantyne's novels over time.

<p>This repository also contains an image of the topic modeling I performed on the entire corpus, a copy of my reflection, and a copy of my PowerPoint presentation.
